    "    * `labels` (`Int64Tensor[N]`): the label for each bounding box\n",
    "    * `image_id` (`Int64Tensor[1]`): an image identifier. It should be unique between all the images in the dataset, and is used during evaluation\n",
    "    * `area` (`Tensor[N]`): The area of the bounding box. This is used during evaluation with the COCO metric, to separate the metric scores between small, medium and large boxes.\n",

Note that for data augmentation, the notion of flipping a keypoint is dependent on the data representation, and you should probably adapt `references/detection/transforms.py` for your new keypoint representation\n",
